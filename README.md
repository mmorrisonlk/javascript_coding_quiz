# smu_code_quiz

Alright, new assignment, this time I need to build a website that can deliver a multiple choice code quiz with a timer and a leaderboard. So I've first organized my assets and index since I don't have anything to start with this time around. My focus is going to be fleshing out a static mock up in html and style it somewhat in css. That should help me identify what I will need to define for variables and help me visualize what I need to add.

So I have my mock up laid out in a way that I can visualize what ids I'll need. My next hurdle that I want to focus on is getting the Javascript to find and replace text properly. My idea is to get each of the texts correctly replacing individually and then try to get them to all replace the text at the same time.

It looks like I have the basics set up and working. My next thought is how I will store the question and answers. My plan is to create an array of an array. By creating this correctly it should allow me to call an index that will select a question and the website should be able to use the question information because the questions, options and correct answers will all be stored at the same index in a given array. We will first work towards a working version of a simple array before adding multiple questions.
